<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, My name is Daniel, your website developer. 
  I’m a passionate full-stack developer with a love for turning ideas into fully functional, 
  beautifully crafted websites. I specialize in building websites from the ground up using programming 
  languages and modern frameworks, bringing both the front-end and back-end together seamlessly.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in coding and a keen eye for detail, I create responsive, user-friendly 
  web applications that not only look great but perform efficiently. Whether it's developing dynamic 
  user interfaces, setting up robust server-side logic, or integrating databases, I enjoy every step 
  of the process.</p>

<p>My goal is to build digital experiences that are not just functional but also meaningful. Let’s bring 
  your vision to life through clean code and creative design.</p>

<p>Let’s work together to bring your next project to life.
